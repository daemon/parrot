gsm8k hard	If the sum of three consecutive integers is 72, what are the integers? Explain your reasoning.	"To find the three consecutive integers whose sum is 72, we can use a bit of logical reasoning. Let's denote the three integers as x, (x+1), and (x+2). According to the problem, their sum is 72, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 72

Now, let's solve for x by combining like terms:

3x + 3 = 72

Next, subtract 3 from both sides to isolate x:

3x = 72 - 3
3x = 69

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 69 / 3
x = 23

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the other two integers:

(x+1) = 23 + 1 = 24
(x+2) = 23 + 2 = 25

So, the three consecutive integers are 23, 24, and 25."	5.0
gsm8k hard	If 5 times a number decreased by 3 equals 2 times the number increased by 7, what is the number? Show your work.	"Let's solve this equation step by step:

1. First, let's find the number (x) when it is decreased by 3 five times:
   -5 * (x - 3)

2. Next, let's find the number (x) when it is increased by 7 two times:
   x + 7 * 2

3. According to the question, these two expressions should be equal, so we can set them equal to each other:
   -5 * (x - 3) = x + 7 * 2

4. Now, let's distribute the negative sign on the left side of the equation:
   -5 * x + 5 * 3 = x + 14

5. To isolate x, we can first subtract x from both sides of the equation:
   -5 * x + 5 * 3 - x = 14

6. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   -4 * x + 15 = 14

7. Now, let's move 15 to the right side of the equation:
   -4 * x = 14 - 15

8. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   -4 * x = -1

9. Finally, divide both sides by -4 to solve for x:
   x = (-1) / (-4)

10. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   x = 1/4

So, the number is 1/4."	1.0
gsm8k hard	A triangle has sides of lengths 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm. Is this a right triangle? Explain your reasoning using the Pythagorean theorem.	"To determine if a triangle with sides of lengths 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- a = 7 cm (the first side)
- b = 24 cm (the second side)
- c (the hypotenuse, which we're trying to find)

According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

a² + b² = c²

Now, let's calculate the squares of the sides:

a² = 7² = 49
b² = 24² = 576

Now, we can compare the sum of the squares of the first two sides with the square of the hypotenuse:

49 + 576 = 625

However, the given third side is 25 cm, and we calculated the hypotenuse to be 625 cm. Since the lengths don't match, this triangle is not a right triangle because it does not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem."	2.0
gsm8k hard	If a person invests $1000 at an annual interest rate of 5% compounded annually, how much will the investment be worth after 3 years? Provide a detailed solution.	"To find the future value of an investment with compound interest, we can use the formula:

Future Value (FV) = Principal * (1 + Interest Rate)^Number of Years

In this case, the principal is $1000, the interest rate is 5% (or 0.05 as a decimal), and the number of years is 3.

So, the calculation would be:

FV = $1000 * (1 + 0.05)^3

First, let's calculate (1 + 0.05):

(1 + 0.05) = 1.05

Now, we raise this value to the power of 3:

(1.05)^3 ≈ 1.157625

Finally, we multiply the principal by this value:

FV = $1000 * 1.157625 ≈ $1157.63

So, after 3 years, the investment will be worth approximately $1157.63."	5.0
gsm8k hard	A cylindrical tank has a radius of 4 meters and a height of 10 meters. What is the volume of the tank in cubic meters? Show your calculations.	"To find the volume of a cylinder, we use the formula:

Volume = π * r^2 * h

where r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

In this case, the radius (r) is 4 meters, and the height (h) is 10 meters. So, the volume of the tank would be:

Volume = π * (4 meters)^2 * 10 meters
Volume = 3.14159 * 16 square meters * 10 meters
Volume = 502.6548 cubic meters (approximately)

So, the volume of the cylindrical tank is approximately 502.6548 cubic meters."	5.0
gsm8k hard	If a train travels 120 miles in 1.5 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour? Explain your reasoning.	The average speed of the train can be calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the time taken. In this case, the train traveled 120 miles in 1.5 hours. So, the average speed is 120 miles / 1.5 hours = 80 miles per hour. This is a straightforward calculation based on the formula for average speed: Speed = Distance / Time.	5.0
gsm8k hard	A car travels 60 miles in the first hour and 90 miles in the second hour. What is the car's average speed for the entire trip? Show your calculations.	"To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time.

First, let's calculate the total distance traveled by the car:
- In the first hour, the car travels 60 miles.
- In the second hour, the car travels 90 miles.
- So, the total distance traveled is 60 + 90 = 150 miles.

Next, we know that the car traveled for two hours in total (one hour for each leg of the trip).

Now, we can calculate the average speed:
- Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 2 hours = 75 miles per hour.

So, the car's average speed for the entire trip is 75 miles per hour."	5.0
gsm8k hard	A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle? Show your work.	"To find the dimensions of the rectangle, we first need to understand that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by the formula 2*(length + width). In this case, the length is twice the width, so we can represent the length as L and the width as W.

The equation for the perimeter would be:

2*(L + W) = 36

Since the length is twice the width, we can substitute L with 2W in the equation:

2*(2W + W) = 36

Now, let's simplify the equation:

2*(3W) = 36

6W = 36

To find W, we divide both sides by 6:

W = 36 / 6
W = 6 units

Now that we have the width, we can find the length by multiplying the width by 2:

L = 2 * 6
L = 12 units

So, the dimensions of the rectangle are a length of 12 units and a width of 6 units."	5.0
gsm8k hard	A mixture contains 30% alcohol and 70% water. If you have 200 ml of this mixture, how much alcohol is in it? Provide a detailed solution.	"To find the amount of alcohol in the mixture, we first need to understand the proportions. Since the mixture is 30% alcohol and 70% water, for every 100 parts of the mixture, 30 parts are alcohol and 70 parts are water.

Now, let's convert the volume of the mixture from milliliters (ml) to parts. Since there are 1000 milliliters in a liter, and our mixture is 100 parts, 1 milliliter of the mixture equals 0.01 parts.

So, if you have 200 milliliters of the mixture, you have 200 * 0.01 = 2 parts of the mixture.

Since the mixture is 30% alcohol, the amount of alcohol in 2 parts of the mixture would be 2 * 0.3 = 0.6 parts or 0.6 liters * 1000 ml/L = 600 ml of alcohol.

Therefore, there are 600 milliliters of alcohol in 200 milliliters of the given mixture."	1.0
gsm8k hard	A tank can be filled by one pipe in 3 hours and emptied by another pipe in 5 hours. If both pipes are open, how long will it take to fill the tank? Provide a detailed solution.	"To solve this problem, let's first find out how much water each pipe fills or empties the tank per hour.

1. The tank is filled by one pipe in 3 hours, so the rate at which this pipe fills the tank is 1/3 of the tank per hour.

2. The tank is emptied by another pipe in 5 hours, so the rate at which this pipe empties the tank is 1/5 of the tank per hour.

When both pipes are open, they work simultaneously. To find the combined rate, we add the rates of both pipes:

Combined rate = Rate of filling pipe + Rate of emptying pipe
= (1/3) + (-1/5)

To add fractions with different denominators, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. So, we multiply both the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 3 to make the denominators equal:

Combined rate = (1/3) + (3/15)
= (1+3)/15
= 4/15

Now, we have the combined rate at which the tank is filled or emptied when both pipes are open. To find out how long it takes for the tank to fill up when both pipes are open, we need to find the time it takes for the tank to be filled by the combined rate:

Time = Tank volume / Combined rate
= Tank volume * (1/Combined rate)
= Tank volume * (15/4)

Since we don't know the volume of the tank, we can't provide a specific time. However, we now know that it takes 15/4 times the time it takes for one pipe to fill the tank when both pipes are open."	2.0
